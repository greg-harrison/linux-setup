semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm
===========================================

## Usage

    $ npm install semver

    semver.valid('1.2.3') // '1.2.3'
    semver.valid('a.b.c') // null
    semver.clean('  =v1.2.3   ') // '1.2.3'
    semver.satisfies('1.2.3', '1.x || >=2.5.0 || 5.0.0 - 7.2.3') // true
    semver.gt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // false
    semver.lt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // true

As a command-line utility:

    $ semver -h

    Usage: semver <version> [<version> [...]] [-r <range> | -i <inc> | --preid <identifier> | -l | -rv]
    Test if version(s) satisfy the supplied range(s), and sort them.

    Multiple versions or ranges may be supplied, unless increment
    option is specified.  In that case, only a single version may
    be used, and it is incremented by the specified level

    Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies
    all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions.

    If no versions are valid, or ranges are not satisfied,
    then exits failure.

    Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying
    multiple versions to the utility will just sort them.

## Versions

A "version" is described by the `v2.0.0` specification found at
<http://semver.org/>.

A leading `"="` or `"v"` character is stripped off and ignored.

## Ranges

A `version range` is a set of `comparators` which specify versions
that satisfy the range.

A `comparator` is composed of an `operator` and a `version`.  The set
of primitive `operators` is:

* `<` Less than
* `<=` Less than or equal to
* `>` Greater than
* `>=` Greater than or equal to
* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,
  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.

For example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions
`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`
or `1.1.0`.

Comparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,
which is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators
it includes.

A range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A
version matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least
one of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.

For example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions
`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,
or `1.1.0`.

The range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,
`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.
